I am working on this civil engineering quiz website for bachelor degree students in my university. And the overarching goal is to essentially analyze whether using this website will benefit students and their grades or not. To do that there are several components I need to complete and I have decided to adopt a game world like interface. For now we can focus on the admin side of things where the admin is able to perform CRUD operations.

For context: we have subjects (so for now just three), inside each subject, we have different topics.
Inside each topic, there can be three types of content: questions (mcqs, t/f and so forth), flashcards and media (mainly videos from youtube/youtube shorts). Currently, the media is not correctly setup since when I demo'ed the website, I included simulation and gallery but I came to know we just need to put videos there but I am guessing even for videos it cannot just be watching but perhaps some text accompanying it? I don't know.

Check the admin page, I have completed the subjects, topics and questions, flashcards and media. Let's focus on the "media" now only. Since I revised media to only display youtube videos/shorts. We need to adequately update the student media to match this change.


what do you suggest I do next. You may suggest next implementation steps, issues with current steps or improvements to the overall user experience to make it easier for data entry (crud operations).

I am trying to correctly implement the Media logic for admin and students. One issue I am facing is that the engagement is not being properly saved/loaded to/from DB. We need to be clever here especially how we save/load so we avoid putting unnecessary load on the DB/crud operations. We also need to plan how to effectively save it to DB.

Analyze the Media page in admin side of things. Do you see how we group the subject-topic items under the same collapsible/expandible card? I was wondering if we should replicate this logic to Questions and Flashcards pages.

Focus on the Questions in the admin page. I was trying to implement the idea below:

Context provided for current progress: I had this idea to add an option for the admin is that to allow them to have sections in Questions. So for example, in a given subject and topic, right now any created question will all be under the same view so students will see it all eventually. But we have one more layer where the admin can create sections so a group of questions belong to one section and so on. By default it will be one section so it shows as it is but there can be more than one section so when presented to the students, it will be displayed section by section. And the admin can configure this, they can choose to only show ONE section randomly to the students when they click questions or allow students to move to next section only once they have completed the previous section and provide admin to enable/disable option to move between sections for the students. Or allow admin to configure to move to next sections only if the student scores above some % in the given section.

The current issue is that the section creation logic is a bit weird in my opinion.

Instead of having a separate section logic like we do now I had this idea, I need you to evaluate if its a good idea. Basically when we have a subject-topic combo, currently in the Questions page, we have the main card which shows Subject -> Topic right? What if we showed that by default for all subject-topic combos regardless if they have questions/sections. But of course, if they are empty, we will disable the reorder button. But we will have a new button next to the reorder which is to add new section. So new sections are directly added in this page instead of having separate section page.

Do you get my idea? Analyze all relevant files to understand the context.

I am trying to implement student tracking to the quiz website where our research is to essentially evaluate whether doing the quiz content helps the student get better grades. To do this, we have several subjects, inside each subject, there are several topics. Within each topic, there can be questions (several sections), flashcards and media (long videos and shorts). The idea of tracking is to essentially track every interaction of the student, what they do in the website, where do they click, how long and everything possible to track that would be useful for analysis. BUT we need to only capture the interactions, timings and so forth that would be useful for research, not purely for tracking purposes. We also need to track how long they took in each question when tracking their scores, how long for flashcards, how long for media. Then show the useful data to the admin page. Check all relevant files to have a thorough understanding first.

One issue is that, in the questions, we can have several sections for questions. and the admin is able to select how these sections are presented (configured in the questions admi page). The issue is, in some cases, it is configured that the subsequent sections are unlocked once the user completes or scores above some score. Say the subsequent sections are set to unlock when user scores > 70%. The user scores > 70% and the next section unlocks and they complete it too! But later the student decides to re-do the first section and they score 0%. Does this cause the latter sections to be locked even if they had unlocked/completed it before?

I need you to analyze each of the content pages and check if the XP rewarding/tracking is correctly implemented. The idea is we only reward XP in two ways: daily OR the first time students complete the content.
For daily: they can get XP for the content they had done before but it will only be fraction of the original XP (say 50%). So once for each content as well.
For first time: say they completed a questions section first time, they get XP reward, but if they do it again the same day, they don't get anymore XP for that completed questions section. If they study all flashcards for a given topic, they get XP. If they watch long video, they get XP. If they watch shorts (first time), they get XP

I need you to check all relevant pages and see if the XP tracking/rewarding is correctly implemented in the pages, DBs loading/saving.

Context: We have several subjects, inside each subject, there are several topics. Within each topic, there can be questions (several sections), flashcards and media (long videos and shorts). The site is for Bachelor degree students where they will do quizzes and improve their knowledge basically.

I need you to analyze each of the content pages and focus on the Dashboard page for students. I need you to analyze if the current version is correctly setup with the loading/saving. Especially the quick actions, are they dynamic in the sense, tailored for current students progress. Do the achievements work correctly, are they adequate and correct. Basically the entire dashboard and the content associated with it. Is it correctly set up, saving and loading correctly, and everything else.

I was trying to implement the tracking for the students where in the admin side of things, the admin can see the useful/critical insights (/analytics).

All interaction related implementations are in the commit 44314d23b5f95d7b84a5a67d49a63f9ae3c42197. 

I need you to check if we correctly implemented the session tracking. How does it currently work?

I am trying to revamp and improve the student dashboard and the latest changes can be found at: commit 134bea2764e7380da02f4464388f9032d06439fc

There is an issue with the /quiz/random where I currently don't see any questions, it's just empty where it doesn't show the question nor answers or anything. Just disabled submit answer and next/previous

I need to implement the Leaderboard for students (so we can link it in the Navbar as a new button and also student dashboard). How do you suggest we go about it. Check all relevant files.

Do you see in the admin side of things, we have unimplemented /admin/users (User Management) page. What do you suggest we should implement/include in that page. Analyze all relevant files thoroughly and provide a plan.

I need you to thoroughly analyze the platform and see if you can find any CRITICAL bugs, issues or improvements that can be done to improve the overall user experience for both admin and students. Check all relevant files.

CRITICAL here means something that can break the entire platform or cause data loss or incorrect data saving/loading. Or something that can cause security issues. Or something that can cause major user experience issues.

I need you to analyze how we store the questions (sections), flashcards and media (both). Basically all of the content including subjects, topics and everything. Then I need you to think of a way to implement a back up mechanism where the admin can back up all the data in a JSON file and also be able to restore from that JSON file, OR store to DB. Analyze all relevant files.
