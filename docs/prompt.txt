I am working on this civil engineering quiz website for bachelor degree students in my university. And the overarching goal is to essentially analyze whether using this website will benefit students and their grades or not. To do that there are several components I need to complete and I have decided to adopt a game world like interface. For now we can focus on the admin side of things where the admin is able to perform CRUD operations.

For context: we have subjects (so for now just three), inside each subject, we have different topics.
Inside each topic, there can be three types of content: questions (mcqs, t/f and so forth), flashcards and media (mainly videos from youtube/youtube shorts). Currently, the media is not correctly setup since when I demo'ed the website, I included simulation and gallery but I came to know we just need to put videos there but I am guessing even for videos it cannot just be watching but perhaps some text accompanying it? I don't know.

Check the admin page, I have completed the subjects, topics and questions so far. Let's focus on the "flashcards" now only. what do you suggest I do next. You may suggest next implementation steps, issues with current steps or improvements to the overall user experience to make it easier for data entry (crud operations).
